# TrapperTracker: Protecting Our Pets, Empowering Our Communities

## The Problem: Scattered Warnings, Vulnerable Pets

In today's world, pet owners often rely on fragmented social media posts and word-of-mouth to stay informed about dangers to their beloved animals. Information about pet trappers, lost pets, or dangerous wildlife is scattered, hard to verify, and often reaches people too late. This inefficiency leaves our pets vulnerable and communities anxious.

## Our Solution: TrapperTracker - Real-time Pet Safety at Your Fingertips

TrapperTracker is a revolutionary, real-time, map-based community safety application designed to centralize and visualize critical information for pet owners. Our mission is to replace the chaos of scattered warnings with an easy-to-use, reliable service that provides:

*   **Danger Zone Alerts:** Clearly visualize areas where pet trappers are active, allowing pet owners to take preventative measures.
*   **Lost & Found Pet Hub:** A centralized platform for reporting and viewing lost and found pets, significantly increasing the chances of happy reunions.
*   **Dangerous Animal Sightings:** Alerts for dangerous wildlife or domestic animals in specific areas, enhancing community safety.

Built with a **cost-first architecture** entirely within the free tiers of Cloudflare services, TrapperTracker is committed to remaining accessible and sustainable. We are an **open-source, community-driven** project, fostering trust, transparency, and collaboration.
