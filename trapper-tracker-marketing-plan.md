You can add a found pet report here: [Website Link]/report

It centralizes the information and could help this pet get home faster. Thanks again for being a good samaritan!"

Our platform ([Website Link]) features a real-time map for tracking lost and found pets, as well as reporting danger zones like trapper activity.

## 4. Media Outreach: Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**New Free Web App, TrapperTracker, Launches to Protect [Your City] Pets from Trapper Dangers**

**[Your City], [State] – [Date]** – A local pet owner has launched TrapperTracker, a free, community-driven web application designed to combat the growing threat of pet trapping and help reunite lost pets with their owners. The platform provides a real-time, map-based view of pet-related dangers, empowering residents to protect their furry family members.

The initiative was born out of rising community concern over scattered social media reports of pets being injured, stolen, or killed by illegally placed traps. TrapperTracker ([Website Link]) offers a centralized solution where users can anonymously report and view the exact locations of:
- Suspected trapper activity and active traps.
- Other potential dangers, such as coyote packs or poison alerts.
- Lost and found pets, creating a public, map-based recovery network.

"I was tired of feeling helpless, reading story after story on Facebook about another pet gone missing or hurt," said [Your Name], the creator of TrapperTracker. "I wanted to create a simple, immediate, and free tool that could turn that scattered information into a powerful, preventative resource for the whole community. If this app saves even one pet, it's a success."

Since its quiet launch, the platform has already logged over [Number of Reports] reports from users in the [Your City] area. The goal is to create a comprehensive safety net, powered by neighbors looking out for one another.

TrapperTracker is a non-commercial project. It is free to use, contains no ads, and is optimized for mobile devices for on-the-go reporting.

**About TrapperTracker:**
TrapperTracker is a community safety tool that provides real-time, map-based information to help pet owners protect their pets. For more information or to view the live map, visit [Website Link].

---

### Ad Copy Variations (Short & Punchy)

2.  **Lost/Found Focus:** "Lost pet in [Your City]? Found a wandering dog? Our free community map helps reunite lost pets with their families. See the map now. #LostDog #[YourCity]"
3.  **Community Angle:** "Protect the pets of [Your City]. Join your neighbors on TrapperTracker, the free community-powered map for reporting pet dangers and finding lost animals. #Community"

### Headlines (Under 40 Characters)

- [Your City] Pet Safety Map
- Protect Your Pet
- Free Trapper Alert Map
- Lost Pet? Check Here
- Community Pet Watch

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons

- **Learn More** (Most neutral, good for initial awareness)
- **Use App** (Direct and clear, as it's a web app)
- **Sign Up** (Only if you have a user registration feature)

### Ad Targeting Recommendations

- **Location:** ZIP codes within [Your City] + 5-10 mile radius. Start small and local.
- **Age:** 25-65+
- **Detailed Targeting (Interests & Behaviors):**
    - **Interests:** Dog park, Pet adoption, Petfinder, Chewy, Petco, PetSmart, *and* must also match *local community groups*.
    - **Behaviors:** Pet owners (Facebook category).
    - **Layering:** Target people who like "Dog park" AND are "Pet owners".
- **Lookalike Audiences:** Once you have ~100 users, you can create a Lookalike Audience to find people similar to your existing users. This is very powerful.

### Budget & A/B Testing

- **Budget:** Start small ($5-$10 per day). Focus on a single, well-defined geographic area.
- **A/B Testing:**
    - **Test Creative:** Run the same ad copy with two different images (e.g., a map screenshot vs. a photo of a dog on a leash).
    - **Test Copy:** Run the same image with two different ad copy variations (e.g., Safety-First vs. Lost/Found Focus).
    - Let ads run for 3-5 days before deciding on a winner.

### Ad Creative Suggestions

- **Image 1:** A clean, compelling screenshot of the TrapperTracker map with several different icons visible in a familiar area.
- **Image 2:** A high-quality, emotionally resonant photo of a person walking their dog, with a subtle graphic overlay saying "Keep Them Safe."
- **Video (Advanced):** A 15-second screen recording showing how easy it is to view the map and make a report on a phone.

## 7. Influencer Outreach: Partnership Pitch

**Goal:** Leverage trusted voices in the local pet community.

### Pitch Template (for Instagram DM or Email)

**Subject:** Partnering to Protect [Your City]'s Pets

**Hi [Influencer's Name],**

I'm [Your Name], a huge admirer of your page and a fellow pet lover in [Your City].

I recently launched a free, non-profit web tool called TrapperTracker ([Website Link]) to help our community map pet danger zones and track lost & found animals in real-time.

Your voice is so trusted in the local pet community. I was hoping you might be willing to check out the tool. If you find it valuable, a single post or story to your followers could make a massive difference in building a safer network for all our pets.

This is a passion project, not a business, so I can't offer payment, but I'd be happy to feature you as a founding community partner on the site.

Let me know if you're open to it!

**Best,**

[Your Name]

## 9. Viral Growth Strategies (That Don't Violate ToS)

1.  **The "Share to See" Mechanic (Soft Version):** When a user submits a report, the confirmation message can say: "Your report has been added! Help make this map even more powerful by sharing it with 3 pet-loving friends or in your favorite local Facebook group." This encourages sharing at the moment of highest engagement.

2.  **Embeddable Map Widget:** Create a simple HTML snippet that allows local shelters, rescues, or bloggers to embed a view of the TrapperTracker map on their own websites. This provides value to them (live, local content) and serves as a constant ad for you.

3.  **"Found Pet" Posters with QR Codes:** When a user generates a "Found Pet" report, give them the option to auto-generate a simple, printable "Found Pet" flyer that includes the pet's photo, details, and a QR code linking directly to the report on the TrapperTracker map. This takes your brand offline and into neighborhoods.

4.  **Community "Safety Zone" Certificates:** A fun, digital "certificate" that a neighborhood can earn once they have a certain number of active users or have gone a certain period without a negative incident. It fosters friendly competition between neighborhoods to sign up.

5.  **Partner with Micro-Influencers:** Don't just go for the big pet pages. Find the person who runs the local "Pug Owners of [Your City]" group of 200 people. A recommendation from a small, tight-knit community leader is often more powerful than a post from a large, impersonal page.
