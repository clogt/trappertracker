### 1. Suggested Image

To create a powerful emotional impact, we suggest a split-screen image:

*   **Top Half (The "Before"):** A grainy, black-and-white, slightly out-of-focus photo of a rain-soaked "Lost Dog" flyer stapled to a telephone pole. The mood is sad and hopeless.
*   **Bottom Half (The "After"):** A bright, warm, and sharp photo of a smiling person joyfully hugging their dog. The mood is one of happiness, relief, and reunion.
*   **Center:** The TrapperTracker logo could be placed subtly on the dividing line between the two images.

This visual tells a story of moving from despair to joy, positioning TrapperTracker as the solution.

### 3. How the "Share on Instagram" Button Works

You cannot automatically create a post on Instagram from a website due to security restrictions. However, you can make it very easy for users to share.

When a user clicks your "Share on Instagram" button, you should:

1.  **Inform the User:** A small pop-up should appear saying something like: "To share, we'll copy the post text to your clipboard. Then, you can create a new post in your Instagram app and paste the text!"
2.  **Copy to Clipboard:** The full caption text from section 2 above should be copied to the user's clipboard automatically using JavaScript.
3.  **(Optional) Provide the Image:** You could also provide a button for them to "Download the Shareable Image" so they can easily save it to their phone's photo library before heading to Instagram.
