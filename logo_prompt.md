### Primary Prompt (Detailed)

Create a modern, vector-style logo for a community safety website called "TrapperTracker". The logo should be clean, easily recognizable, and suitable for a website header and app icon.

**Core Concept:** A stylized map or shield shape that conveys safety and location.

**Key Elements to Include:**
*   A subtle map motif, like contour lines or a simple grid.
*   A single, prominent red marker icon (like a warning "blip" or a sharp-angled pin) to represent a danger zone.
*   A contrasting, friendly-colored (blue or green) map pin icon that contains a small paw print, representing a lost or found pet.
*   The name "TrapperTracker" integrated cleanly, either below or alongside the icon. Use a modern, sans-serif typeface.

**Color Palette:**
*   Primary: Deep Red (#D92E2E), Safety Blue (#3498DB), and a neutral Dark Gray/Charcoal (#333333).
*   Background: White or off-white.

**Style:** Flat design, minimalist, high-contrast, with clean lines and no gradients. The overall feeling should be professional and trustworthy, yet compassionate.

**Example Prompt:**
> A modern vector logo for 'TrapperTracker', designed in a flat, minimalist style. The logo features a stylized shield outline. Inside the shield, there's a simple map grid. On the map, place a sharp, red warning marker and a separate, friendly blue map pin with a paw print inside it. The name 'TrapperTracker' is written in a clean, sans-serif font below the shield. High contrast, no gradients, on a white background.

### Alternative Prompts (Variations)

**1. Minimalist & Abstract:**
> A minimalist, abstract logo for "TrapperTracker". Use geometric shapes to represent a map. Feature a single red triangle for 'danger' and a blue circle with a paw print cutout for 'safety'. Clean lines, vector, high contrast.

**2. Badge/Emblem Style:**
> A circular badge-style logo for "TrapperTracker". The outer ring contains the text "TRAPPERTRACKER • COMMUNITY SAFETY". The inner circle shows a simple map with a red danger blip and a green pin marking a pet's location. Emblem style, vector, 2D.

**3. Focus on the Path Home:**
> A logo for "TrapperTracker" that features a stylized letter 'T' where the vertical line is a path on a map. The path starts at a red warning marker and ends at a green pin with a paw print, symbolizing the journey from danger to safety. Modern, clever use of negative space.

### Tips for Refining the Logo

*   **Simplify:** If the AI generates something too complex, add words like "simplified," "single icon," or "two elements only."
*   **Change Colors:** Experiment with different color palettes by specifying them, e.g., "Use a color palette of orange, teal, and dark grey."
*   **Font:** If you don't like the text, you can ask the AI to generate the "icon only" and add the text later using graphic design software for better control.
*   **Format:** Add "app icon" or "website favicon" to see how the logo looks in a small, square format.
