            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-3">The Heartbreak: When Our Beloved Pets Are at Risk</h2>
            <p>Every pet owner knows the unconditional love and joy our animals bring into our lives. They're not just pets; they're cherished family members. But with that love comes a constant worry: the fear of them getting lost, encountering danger, or falling victim to malicious acts.</p>

Fragmented social media posts, outdated flyers, and desperate pleas often come too late, leaving pet parents feeling helpless, heartbroken, and alone. This scattered, unreliable system leaves our most vulnerable family members exposed and our communities gripped by anxiety.</p>
